The model performance is measured on a validation set that is different from the training set, in order to assess how well it generalizes. During training, if the performance degrades after several (let's say 50) iterations, it means the model is overfitting and not able to generalize well anymore. Hence, stopping the learning early in this case helps prevent overfitting."
